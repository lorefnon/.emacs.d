# About

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorefnon/.emacs.d/master/assets/screenshot.png)

My primary emacs setup, optimized for my helm+projectile+company+avy centric workflow.

Uses lazy loading (through use-package) to keep startup time to as low as possible (< 1s).

It is pre-configured for web & frontend development (HTML, CSS, JS, TS, SCSS etc.)

This setup is in regular use in Windows and Linux environments.

Use it at your own risk. Feedback and Contributions are welcome.

# Installation

Clone the repository to `~/.emacs.d` and start emacs.

When emacs starts up it will auto download and configure relevant packages.

Has only been tested with Emacs 25.
